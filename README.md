# pi-top-brightness
guizero program to adjust pi-top screen brightness

Small GUI program using GUIZero to change the brightness of a Pi-top/CEED if using Jessie and not pi-topOS.
To use this program you first have to install the code from https://github.com/rricharz/pi-top-install to get the brightness command
While there it's worth installing the shutdown code too as it will shutdown the pi-top hub when you shutdown Jessie

As of the latest Jessie guizero is pre-installed so no other software should need to be installed.
If guizero is not installed then follow these instruction https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/

This program is python 3 and needs to be made executable with  chmod +x pi-top-brightness-gui.py
